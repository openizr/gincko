## Installation

```bash
yarn add gincko
```


## Features

Building user interfaces containing multiple inputs is very repetitive and low-value process. It always contains the same logic, and doesn't fundamentally change much accross apps and websites: we need to implement different types of fields, fields validations logic, transitions, manage form submission, and so on. Why should we always go back to that each time we create a new feature?

gincko is meant to remove these unecessary, time-consuming parts, by providing a common, generic engine that automatically performs usual checks. Through a simple JSON configuration, you can generate deep, complex UIs, without a line of code, so you can focus on the real value of your project.

gincko can be used for a wide variety of use cases, including:
- Forms, surveys
- Profile / settings edition pages, blog post creation, ...
- Contact or support page with ticket creation
- And even chatbots or FAQs!

Why choosing gincko to develop your project?
- Small learning curve, simple concepts
- Tiny JSON configuration for basic use cases
- Completely dynamic form steps generation, based on previous inputs
- Fully extensible and customizable for most complex use cases, using plugins
- Supports React and VueJS natively, although you can also provide your own implementation for them or any other frontend framework
