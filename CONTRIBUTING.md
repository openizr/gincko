## Semantic Versioning

gincko releases follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).


## Branches organization

`master` is the main branch, and contains latest stable code that passes all the tests. We generate
new releases **from this banch only**. Please do not push your code directly on `master`, open a
pull request first so it can be validated by the community. Branches should be named after the
issue they fix, such as `issue-<ISSUE_ID>`, so it is easier for everyone to understand what they
are meant for. If there is no related issue, please open one (see below).


## Contacts

Feel free to open an issue on this repository, I will reply as soon as I can. You can also contact
me directly on:

## Labels naming convention

In order to improve issues management and to make information clearer and easily identifiable, a
set of pre-defined labels has been created. Those labels are strictly structured in three main
groups, each group giving a particular useful information about the issue. It means that for each
issue you open, you must assign it exactly one label of each group, and update them all along the
issue's lifecycle as it evolves.

## Reporting bugs

If you think you found a bug in the code, you can open an issue to report it, so the community can
then work to fix it. Before opening a new issue, make sure the topic is not already being discussed
in another issue, to prevent duplicates. Try to be as clear and exhaustive as possible, so people
can quickly understand what is going on. You can use the following guidelines:

 * **Issue title** explaining the bug in a small and concise sentence.
 * **Version** on which you are experiencing the bug.
 * **Test case** to reproduce the bug. You can link a [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/), [JSBin](https://jsbin.com/), [CodePen](https://codepen.io/#) or any other code snippet to help.
 * **Steps to reproduce** if you don't have any test case link, you can provide a step-by-step process to reproduce the bug.
 * **Expected behaviour** describing what should normally happen.
 * **Actual behaviour** describing what actually happens.
 * **Additional information** like comments, images, GIFs, anything that can help community to correct the issue...

Of course, don't forget to set the correct labels to your issue.


## Proposing changes

As for bugs, feel free to suggest any interesting improvement or new feature. Again, before opening
this kind of request, make sure it is not already a work in progress by checking first the issues
list. You can as well use a similar guideline as the one describe before to make a new request.
Just keep in mind that other contributors have to understand your idea to put it into code.


## Pull Requests

Ready to contribute to the code? That is great, thank you and welcome in the contributors team!
You can create a new branch and open a new pull request to propose your code to the community.

### Naming convention

As for branches name, you should name your pull requests accordingly with the issue they solve
(e.g. `issue-164`). If you wish to give additional information related to that issue, you can fill
the pull request description.

### Prerequisities

To technically contribute to this project, here are the software you will need:
 * A UNIX terminal and an IDE ;)
 * [git](https://git-scm.com/)
 * [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/fr)
 * [nodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en)
 * [npm](https://www.npmjs.com)


## Development workflow and tools

```bash
git clone git@github.com:openizr/gincko.git
cd gincko
yarn install
yarn run dev    # Compile your changes in real time
yarn run test -w  # Run an interactive test watcher
yarn run doc      # Generate documentation
```


## Maintenance

In order to keep project up-to-date, dependencies updates should be checked and updated regularily,
using the `yarn outdated` and `yarn upgrade-interactive --latest` commands. Here is the list of
repositories changelogs to watch for updates:
- [typescript-dev-kit](https://github.com/matthieujabbour/typescript-dev-kit/releases)


## Build & Deployment

You don't have to worry about deploying the code and publishing it on `npm`, the CI/CD system does
it for you (using TravisCI). Each time a new release is created on the `master` branch, TravisCI
will automatically build and deploy this release on `npm` with the version you specified in your
release name. Of course, all tests must pass otherwise code won't be deployed. However, if you want
to get an preview of the distributed package, you can run `yarn run build`. Assets will be compiled
into a `dist` directory at the project's root.


## Guidelines

### Typescript

gincko Typescript codebase follows the [AirBnB Javascript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript),
adapted to Typescript specificities of course. Several IDE extensions are available to automatically
lint your code whenever you save files.

### Git commits

To provide good and clear git commit messages, you should follow [these guidelines](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).


## Project structure

Project is structured as follow:
- **`/docs`:** contains the complete documentation generated from code comments
- **`/scripts`:** contains utility scripts related project's lifecycle (initialization, ...)
- **`/src`:** contains the actual codebase and unit tests
